# Maya Pivot
A blender addon that implements features for the 3D cursor inspired by Maya's pivot system.

When in edit mode theres a panel in the edit section called Maya Pivot which lets you modify the pivot position orientation and z axis based on selected faces. Then just switch to cursor in the transform orientation menu.

I always liked the way maya handled this and wanted a version of it in blender.

The cursor orientation code was inspired by the transform orientation method in https://github.com/jlampel/orient_to_selection
